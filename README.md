# UPDATES :

* V0.0.1 : First commit

# KNOWN PROBLEMS :

* The birds send to another players can be a little bit "glitchy" and crash on the walls and windows if you are in interiors but honestly, i wanted to let the script like that 'cause it given me serious lauthing times

* The cities that are named in upper right side of the letters are not all implemented yet in the script so it will display hash instead of city/country name

# FUTURE PLANS :

* not for the moment
